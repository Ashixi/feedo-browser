# Feedo Browser

Feedo Browser is a native, privacy-first web browser built specifically to seamlessly navigate **Feedo**. 

It natively understands `.feedo` domains, completely bypassing traditional DNS and centralized web hosts. It fetches content directly from the decentralized Feedo Storage Network using IPFS-inspired Content Identifiers (CIDs) and verifies ownership via the Feedo Consensus Network.

## Features

- **Native Resolution**: Type `anyname.feedo` in the URL bar and the browser instantly resolves it via the Feedo Consensus Network.
- **Decentralized Storage Engine**: Pages and assets are fetched directly from decentralized Storage Nodes.
- **Integrated Wallet**: Built-in Feedo Identity wallet for signing transactions, registering domains, and managing your DID.
- **Cross-Platform**: Built with Flutter for a fast, fluid experience on Desktop and Mobile.
- **Rust Core**: Cryptography and peer-to-peer networking logic are powered by a high-performance Rust core via `flutter_rust_bridge`.

## Architecture

- **Frontend UI**: Flutter (Dart)
- **Networking & Crypto**: Rust (`rust_engine`)
- **Bridge**: `flutter_rust_bridge`
